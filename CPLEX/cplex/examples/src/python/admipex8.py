"""
Solve a capacitated facility location problem with cutting planes using
the new generic callback interface.

See admipex5.py for an implementation using legacy callbacks.

We are given a set of candidate locations J and a set of clients C.
Facilities should be opened in some of the candidate locations so that
the clients' demand can be served. The facility location problem consists
of deciding in which locations facilities should be opened and assigning
each client to a facility at a minimum cost.

A fixed cost is incurred when opening a facility, and a linear cost is
associated with the demand supplied from a given facility to a client.

Furthermore, each facility has a capacity and can only serve |C| - 1
clients. Note that in the variant of the problem considered here, each
client is served by only one facility.

The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program using binary
variables: used[j], for all locations j in J, indicating if a facility is
opened in location j; supply[c][j], for each client c in C and facility j
in J, indicating the demand of client c supplied from facility j.

Thus, the following model formulates the facility location problem:

 Minimize sum(j in J) fixedCost[j] * used[j] +
          sum(j in J) sum(c in C) cost[c][j] * supply[c][j]
 Subject to:
   sum(j in J) supply[c][j] == 1                    for all c in C,
   sum(c in C) supply[c][j] <= (|C| - 1) * used[j]  for all j in J,
   supply[c][j] in {0, 1}                   for all c in C, j in J,
   used[j] in {0, 1}                                for all j in J.

The first set of constraints are the demand constraints ensuring that the
demand of each client is satisfied. The second set of constraints are the
capacity constraints, ensuring that if a facility is placed in location j
the capacity of that facility is not exceeded.

The program in this file, formulates a facility location problem and
solves it. Furthermore, different cutting planes methods are implemented
using the generic callback API to help the solution of the problem:

- Disaggregated capacity cuts separated algorithmically (see the
  FacilityCallback.disaggregate method for details),

- Disaggregated capacity cuts separated using a cut table (see the
  FacilityCallback.cutsFromTable method for details),

- Capacity constraints separated as lazy constraints (see the
  FacilityCallback.lazyCapacity method for details).

Those different methods are invoked using the generic callback API.

See the usage message below for how to switch between these options.
