"""Demonstrates how to perform customized branching using the generic
callback.

For any model with integer variables passed on the command line, the
code will solve the model using a simple customized branching strategy.
The branching strategy implemented here is most-infeasible branching,
i.e., the code always picks the integer variable that is most fractional
and then branches on it. If the biggest fractionality of all integer
variables is small then the code refrains from custom branching and lets
CPLEX decide.

See usage message below.
